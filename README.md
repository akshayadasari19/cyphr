## 💫 CYPHR : A GUI containing different cypher modes with Tkinter
 CYPHR is a user interface that contains four different classic ciphers i.e.
Affine
Atbash
Caesar
Rail-fence

It provides a fun way for users to play around and experiment with how different ciphers work!
This project is written entirely in python. To implement the GUI we used Tkinter module.

To run it locally, simply fork the repo and run the code! It'll open up CYPHR's home page and you can have fun exploring the four ciphers.
