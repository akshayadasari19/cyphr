## 💫 CYPHR : A GUI containing different cypher modes with Tkinter

CYPHR is a user interface that contains four different classic ciphers:
- Affine  
- Atbash  
- Caesar  
- Rail Fence  

It provides a fun way for users to play around and experiment with how different ciphers work.  
This project is written entirely in Python. To implement the GUI, we used the Tkinter module.

To run it locally, simply fork the repository and run the code.  
It will open up CYPHR's home page and you can have fun exploring the four ciphers.
